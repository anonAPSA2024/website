    "text": "My research agenda explores how cognitive processes influence policy adoption regarding international relations. As the world grows evermore interconnected, assuming populations and politicians behave as perfectly informed rational actors is insufficient. Humans seek to make the political decisions that are most likely to benefit them but often lack information on the complicated processes influencing their lives and instead are moved by social pressures or cognitive biases. Understanding how inherent cognitive mechanisms hamper rational decision-making is critical, especially in international relations, where actors make decisions about conflict, trade, or migration that potentially affect millions of people. Humans cannot be rewired, but policies, processes, and interventions can be designed with our limitations in mind to ensure equitable outcomes in an ever-changing world.\nUnderpinning this broad research goal are several concrete areas of interest. The first is international relations policy. My article “Leader’s Gendered Rhetoric and Aggressive Foreign Policy” explores how pressures to perform masculinely may influence women leaders to enact more militant foreign policy. It also utilizes leaders’ rhetoric to explore the development of this gendered performance through their careers. The results of this project suggest that women leaders use more aggressive rhetoric than women politicians who are not in positions of power. It also finds that this relationship decreases with women’s representation in legislatures, suggesting as more women are elected into office, the pressure for women leaders to behave more masculinely decreases.\nMy second research interest is social cognition. Specifically, I am interested in the processes by which individuals collect information and learn. My experiment, the “Instrumental Consumption of Emotional Media,” proposes that individuals may selectively expose themselves to emotional media to make political decisions more efficiently. The logic of this theory relies on the finding that certain emotional states cause individuals to be less risk-averse and make quicker decisions. Building off this finding, since humans prefer to make decisions using the least amount of cognitive effort required, this experiment proposes that individuals consume media to instill emotional states that allow for more efficient decision-making and finds evidence of this behavior.\nMy third research interest is migration. At the intersection of migration and international relations policy is my first dissertation chapter, “A Unified Theory of Asylum Policy Making,” which introduces a novel theoretical concept of restrictive capacity to explain variation in the adoption of restrictive asylum policies. It finds evidence that a state’s capacity to restrict incoming asylum flows and the number of outflowing asylum seekers from nearby states can predict asylum policy adoption across and within regions.\nRelating to all three of these areas of interest is my second dissertation chapter, ” Knowledge of Job Insecurities and Policy Preferences,” which I seek funding for in this grant proposal. This project explores how workers form preferences about trade and migration policies contingent on their perceptions–or misperceptions–of occupation-level job insecurity. Original survey data will be collected regarding workers’ perceptions of job risk and will experimentally manipulate workers’ perceptions of job risk to determine how they influence policy support."
